# Data Structures & Algorithms

The data structure and algorithms i struggled with after exploring the interactive visualization on https://visualgo.net/en are as follows:

## Linked List
- This was too complex to visualize, and it has multiply types of linked lists and I don't understand their differences.

- It uses nodes and pointers, but I don't understand how that works in practice.

- I can't figure out how linked lists are structured or how they work in programming.

* Binary Heaps
- It involves tree structures, which i haven't learned yet, making it hard to follow.

- It is used in things like 'priorty queues', I don't know what that means.

* Graph Structures
- I don't fully understand the different ways to represent graphs. I don't know when or why to use them.

- Terms like nodes, edges, directed and undirected graphs, BFS, DFS makes no sense to me.

- I have no idea how graphs are stored or used in code.
